The pinout diagram for the digispark pro shows that the led is tied to
PORT B1.  It also shows other PORT B pins are used for other stuff
so we should do a read-modify-write when messing with that port.  Need
to set DDRB bit 1 (0x02) to a 1 to make it an output then we can
toggle pin 1 to make the led blink.
